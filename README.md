super raw project (bear with me)

Instructions:
1) clone project
2) insert your todolist into input.txt
3) run python meta.py
4) use your left and right arrow keys, and enter, to rate each task/idea, first by it's importance, then by it's urgency
5) close the app, and take all curated tasks from data/list3.csv file (leave the first line). enjoy your eisenhower-curated list :)
